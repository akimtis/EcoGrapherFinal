# Data Preserves
##A graphing tool to compare sets of ecological data for students to use in their Desert Data Jam projects.
###Group Project 1: Rutgers Coding Bootcamp

##Synopsis:
####This app helps middle school and high school students quickly visualize and compare ecology data sets without needing to use a program like Excel. They will use this graph generator to display sets of data and zoom in on specific parts of the data sets. These graphs will help the students understand the data trends, and be able to explain those trends to non-scientists as part of the Desert Data Jam competition. Data Preserves provides a tool for adding captions and for downloading pdfs of the generated graphs, as well as a glossary of terms.
